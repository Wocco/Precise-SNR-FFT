# Exact FFT measurement of IQ Data
To get a good measurement of a signals power in the frequency domain multiple corrections need to be made. The goal of this code is to correct for spectral leakage, coherent power gain (CPG), scalloping loss, FFT processing gain and Equivalent noise bandwidth (ENWB).
